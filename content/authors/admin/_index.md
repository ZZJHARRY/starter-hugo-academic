Hello! This is Zijian!

I am currently a graduate student studying Data Science at the University of Pennsylvania. In August 2022, I obtained the master of science from the University of Michigan, studying computer science and engineering. In May 2021, I obtained the bachelor of science degree from the University of Michigan, majoring in Computer Science and Pure Mathematics. I am glad to be advised by Prof. [Ivo Dinov](https://www.socr.umich.edu/people/dinov/) at [SOCR](https://www.socr.umich.edu/html/SOCR_Research.html).

Previously, I was advised by Prof. [Hun-Seok Kim](https://kim.engin.umich.edu/) in his [Lab](https://kim.engin.umich.edu/people/) as a research assistant.

During summer 2022, I was a software development engineer intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/). My project was to build a new pipeline in [Amazon Business](https://business.amazon.com/) from stratch.

During summer 2020, I was a software development engineer intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/). My project was to integrate [Amazon Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa) with [Knowledge Graph](https://www.ibm.com/topics/knowledge-graph) service.

Coursework:
- Computer Science and Engineering: Artifical Intelligence(A+), Database(A+), Machine Learning(A), Computer Organization(A+), Data Structure and Algorithms(A), Combinatorics(A), Computer Vision(A), Information Retrival(A+), Natural Language Processing (currently taking), Design and Analysis of Algorithms (currently taking)
- Mathematics: Real Analysis(A), Modern Algebra(A), Multivaribale Calculus(A+), Linear Algebra(A), Differetial Equations(A), Topology(A)
