Hello! This is Zijian! 🧑‍💻

I am currently a graduate student studying Data Science at the [University of Pennsylvania(UPenn)](https://www.upenn.edu/). For this summer of 2023, I am a data science intern at [Climate AI](https://climate.ai/), and I am building a comprehensive dashboard for companies and agronomists to map out long-term climate resilience strategies.

Previously, I graduated from the University of Michigan with M.S. in Computer Science and B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics (dual major). During my study at UMich, I was advised by Dr. [Jamie Samper](https://aiab.wharton.upenn.edu/about-aiab/team/) at [Wharton AI & Analytics for Business (AIAB)](https://aiab.wharton.upenn.edu/), Prof. [Hun-Seok Kim](https://kim.engin.umich.edu/) in his [Lab](https://kim.engin.umich.edu/people/) and by Prof. [Ivo Dinov](https://www.socr.umich.edu/people/dinov/) at [SOCR](https://www.socr.umich.edu/html/SOCR_Research.html) as a research assistant.

During the summer of 2020 and 2022, I was a software development engineer intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/). My internship projects were to integrate [Amazon Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa) with [Knowledge Graph](https://www.ibm.com/topics/knowledge-graph) service, and build a new pipeline in [Amazon Business](https://business.amazon.com/) from scratch, respectively.

🌟 [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Jo5NZniD5iLqnSdQoqxDQ59rKEEc-Jr/view?usp=sharing) is my recent resume!
